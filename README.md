# Guru Android SDK
This sdk makes it easy to integrate the [Guru Platform](https://www.getguru.ai/) with your Android application.

## Getting Started
The SDK is distributed through [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/). 
To add the SDK to your Android project, add the JitPack repository:
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

And then declare the dependency:
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.Formguru:guru-android-sdk:1.0.0'
}
```

To find the latest release versions, check the [Releases](https://github.com/Formguru/guru-android-sdk/releases) page.

Once you have the dependency declared, take a look at our
